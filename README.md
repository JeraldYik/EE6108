# Project for EE

In this project, each student will work to implement 2 routing algorithms, which are Bellman-
Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Any programming language can be used to
generate the codes. The submission of the project should include 1) one original program file
and the corresponding executable file, 2) a testing file, which includes a testing input and
corresponding output, and 3) a project report.

The all 3 files should be compressed as a zip file to be uploaded into the Assignment folder at
the course website in NTULearn. The submission can be made at any time before 1:00am on
November 9th, 2020.

The requirements on the program:

```
1) There should be a friendly user interface to accept the input and demonstrate the
corresponding output.
2) The topology and scale of the input network should be flexible.
3) There should be a line of note to explain each line of the code.
```

The requirements on the project report:

```
1) There should be a literature survey to present some variations of each of the 2 routing
algorithms.
2) There should be a flow chart to demonstrate each coded algorithm.
3) There should be an explanation on the testing case.
```

The advanced requirements:

```
1) Implementation of one variation for each of the 2 routing algorithms.
2) Comparison between them and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra’s
Algorithm in terms of advantages and disadvantages in the report.
```
